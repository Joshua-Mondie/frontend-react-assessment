# Frontend React Assessment

This project includes two main React components:

1. **Task List**: Displays a list of tasks with checkboxes. When a checkbox is checked, the task text is struck through, indicating completion.
2. **User Form**: A simple form with 'name' and 'age' fields. Upon form submission, the entered values are displayed below the form.

## Project Structure

- `UserForm.js`: The User Form component.
- `App.js`: Main application file that integrates both components.

## Prerequisites
